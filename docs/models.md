      FastFlowLM curates the most requested families and publishes tuned manifests under `flm pull <model>`.
      We validate every build on Ryzen™ AI laptops and provide matching cards—see them [here](/docs/models/).
      The catalog already covers 22 models spanning Gemma3 (Vision), Qwen3, GPT-OSS-20B (MoE), DeepSeek-R1, Whisper
      (Audio), MedGemma (Medical), and other leading open families.

        Each manifest describes quantization, context window, tokenizer, and recommended memory,
        so there are no surprises after download.
